# WebAssembly-Learn

This repository contains some simple projects I made while learning WebAssembly for a high school project.
I would not recommend this be used as a reference for propper utilization of WebAssembly but simply to demonstrate how much potential this tool has.

[Here](https://gabekole.github.io/WebAssembly-Learn/11-%20Dynamic%20Fluids/), you can view a dynamic fluid simulation that was built with a library created in the C language.
